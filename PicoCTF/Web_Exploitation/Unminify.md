# Write-Up — Unminify

## General Information

* **Challenge Name**: [Unminify](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/426)
* **Author**: Jeffery John
* **Platform**: picoCTF
* **Category**: Web Exploitation
* **Difficulty**: Easy



## Challenge Description

The challenge presents a simple website that claims to distribute flags. The page states that the browser has successfully received the flag, but the server does not know how to read it. The website’s source code is heavily minified, making it difficult to read at a glance.

The goal is to locate and extract the hidden flag.



## Analysis

Upon loading the webpage, no flag is visible in the rendered content. However, the following message is displayed:

> “If you're reading this, your browser has successfully received the flag.”

This statement strongly implies that the flag has already been delivered to the client and is likely embedded somewhere within the page source rather than retrieved dynamically.

Given this information, the most logical next step is to inspect the HTML source code.



## Exploitation

### Step 1 — View Page Source

The page source was opened using the browser shortcut:

```
Ctrl + U
```

This reveals the raw HTML of the page.



### Step 2 — Inspect Minified HTML

The HTML is compressed into a single line due to minification. By searching for common flag patterns such as `picoCTF{`, the following line was identified:

```html
<p class="picoCTF{pr3tty_c0d3_51d374f0}"></p>
```

The flag is embedded directly inside the `class` attribute of a paragraph element. Since this attribute is not rendered as visible text, the flag does not appear on the webpage itself.



## Flag

```
picoCTF{pr3tty_c0d3_51d374f0}
```



## Conclusion

This challenge demonstrates a fundamental concept in web security:
**any data sent to the client should be considered accessible to the user**.

Minifying code or hiding information in HTML attributes does not provide security. If sensitive data is present in client-side code, it can be easily extracted by inspecting the source.



## Key Takeaways

* Always inspect the raw HTML source when analyzing a web challenge.
* Minification improves readability and performance, not security.
* Client-side content should never be trusted to protect sensitive information.
