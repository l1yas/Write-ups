# picoCTF – where are the robots

## Description

The [challenge](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/4) provides a website:

```
http://fickle-tempest.picoctf.net:61607
```

The goal is to find where the “robots” are located.



## Approach

On websites, automated crawlers (robots) are guided by a standard file called `robots.txt`.
This file tells search engines which paths should not be indexed.

In Capture The Flag challenges, `robots.txt` often reveals hidden or interesting directories.



## Step 1 – Access robots.txt

Navigate to:

```
http://fickle-tempest.picoctf.net:61607/robots.txt
```

The file contains:

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /cc6b1.html
```

This indicates that all robots are instructed not to access the page `/cc6b1.html`.



## Step 2 – Visit the disallowed page

Ignoring the directive, manually navigate to:

```
http://fickle-tempest.picoctf.net:61607/cc6b1.html
```



## Result

The page directly reveals the flag:

```
picoCTF{ca1cu1at1ng_Mach1n3s_cc6b1}
```



## Flag

```
picoCTF{ca1cu1at1ng_Mach1n3s_cc6b1}
```



## Conclusion

* `robots.txt` is publicly accessible and not a security mechanism
* It only provides indexing instructions to search engines
* Sensitive paths should never be relied upon to be hidden via `robots.txt`
* This challenge demonstrates a basic but important web reconnaissance technique
