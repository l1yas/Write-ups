# Write-up: Includes

**Author:** LT “syreal” Jones
**Category:** Web / Client-Side
**Challenge Name:** [Includes](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/274)
**Goal:** Discover the hidden flag by inspecting files included by a web page.



## Challenge Overview

The challenge provides access to a simple website and asks a straightforward question:

> *Can you get the flag?*

No additional instructions are given, which implies that the solution lies in basic web reconnaissance rather than exploitation. The challenge title, **“Includes”**, already hints that the flag may be hidden in files that are included by the main HTML page, such as CSS or JavaScript files.



## Step 1: Interacting with the Website

Upon loading the website, the page appears minimal and does not display any obvious flag.

A button labeled **“Say Hello”** is present. Clicking this button triggers a JavaScript alert with the message:

```
This code is in a separate file!
```

This message is a clear hint that the relevant logic or information is not located directly in the HTML file, but instead in external resources.



## Step 2: Inspecting the Page Structure

Using the browser’s developer tools (Inspect Element), the HTML source is examined. The page includes references to external files:

* A CSS file (`style.css`)
* A JavaScript file (`script.js`)

Since the challenge title explicitly references “Includes,” these files become the primary targets for inspection.



## Step 3: Analyzing the CSS File

Opening `style.css` reveals the following content:

```css
body {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

/* picoCTF{1nclu51v17y_1of2_ */
```

At the bottom of the file, a comment contains what is clearly the **first half of the flag**. Comments in CSS are not rendered by the browser but remain fully visible to anyone inspecting the source.

This confirms that the flag is intentionally split across multiple included files.



## Step 4: Analyzing the JavaScript File

Next, the `script.js` file is inspected. Its contents are:

```javascript
function greetings()
{
  alert("This code is in a separate file!");
}

// f7w_2of2_df589022}
```

Below the JavaScript function, a comment contains the **second half of the flag**. Just like HTML and CSS comments, JavaScript comments are also visible client-side and provide no real security.



## Step 5: Reconstructing the Flag

By combining the two parts found in `style.css` and `script.js`, the complete flag is reconstructed:

```
picoCTF{1nclu51v17y_1of2_f7w_2of2_df589022}
```



## Final Flag

```
picoCTF{1nclu51v17y_1of2_f7w_2of2_df589022}
```



## Key Takeaways

This challenge reinforces several fundamental web security concepts:

1. **All client-side files are readable**
   Any file sent to the browser, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, can be viewed and analyzed by the user.

2. **Comments are not secure storage**
   Developers sometimes mistakenly place sensitive information in comments, assuming users will not look there. In reality, comments are one of the first places attackers check.

3. **External resources must always be inspected**
   Important logic or data is often hidden in files linked via `<script>` or `<link>` tags rather than the main HTML page.

4. **The challenge name matters**
   The title “Includes” directly hinted at the correct approach. Reading and interpreting challenge names is an important CTF skill.



## Conclusion

The **Includes** challenge is a classic introductory web challenge that tests awareness of client-side transparency. By following hints, inspecting included files, and understanding that comments offer no security, the flag can be recovered without any exploitation or complex tooling.

This mirrors real-world web reconnaissance, where sensitive information is often unintentionally exposed in static assets.
